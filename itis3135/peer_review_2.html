			</figure>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Homepage is index.html?</strong> The homepage is index.html</li>
				<li><strong>No spaces or uppercase in file/folder names?</strong>No uppercase or spaces in any file names. File names labeled accordingly and make sense.</li>
				<li><strong>Design</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Contrast/Sizing</strong>: Everything is very easily readable, contrast is fanstastic, and very modern.</li>
						<li><strong>Colors and fonts using css, unless specific</strong>: Colors and fonts are in their own CSS file, no page has inline CSS styling.</li>
						CRAP
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Very natural color pallette, Everything is very clear and easily distinguished.</li>
							<li><strong>Repeition</strong>: Every page feels similar to each other, and feels like the same webpage.</li>
							<li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Pages are centered, while some are to the left. This looks like a styling decision and I quite like it.</li>
							<li><strong>Proximity</strong>: Everything has their own space and is quite even from each other. Proximity seems to be done very well.</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Page has</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Header</strong>: All pages have header included in body. Good looks here.</li>
						<li><strong>Main</strong>: All pages have main included in body. Good looks here too.</li>
						<li><strong>Footer</strong>: All pages have footer included in body. And again, good looks here too.</li>
						<li><strong>Nav Bar Works</strong>: All navigation works great, and they are easily clickable buttons. Header was done very well.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Header has h1</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Branded Page</strong>: Brand name does not seem to be present, however I do not think it is required as it seems the client for this project is a place to show  off their art.</li>
						<li><strong>Page name not in header</strong>: Page name is not in the header, only the nav and brand name is for all pages.</li>
						<li><strong>Understands difference between head, heading, header</strong>: Very clearly knows the difference, the header, main, footer are all in the body for every page.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Main page starts with h2 and does not repeat h1</strong>: Yes, other than a picture on a page or two.</li>
				<li><strong>Page has footer with user pages</strong>: Footer has webpages, Brandon A. Designs webpage does not seem to work. The other link works though.</li>
				<li><strong>Page has specific requirements</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Fully Functional HTML CSS, 5 Page Minimum</strong>: Counted up 5 pages, all with content and works how I feel they were intended, other than a lot of pictures not being loaded in. Alts however are present.</li>
						<li><strong>All code seperate CSS and JS files</strong>: CSS was linked and Javascript is linked for all pages.</li>
						<li><strong>No unnecessary id/classes</strong>: The CSS seems to be all used, and no unnecessary CSS seems to be present.</li>
						<li><strong>All pages have working Nav Bar</strong>: Every page had the same nav bar, all pages work perfectly fine, and go where they are labelled to take you to.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Other Feedback</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li>Images are the biggest thing! was not able to find why they were not working, but I am sure it is an easy fix. The alts should probably reflect more on what they are supposed to be though, that would help a ton.</li>
						<li>In the Portfolio page, how about instead of hovering, it is a togglable click to flip the image to see the description. This would help reduce a user's mild frustration when moving the cursor around the page.</li>
						<li>Since the Project Overview is not directly tied to the client project itself, would you consider moving it to your itis3135 page? This will help the website feel more like its own thing.</li>
						<li>Other than those things, I think this webpage is fantastic! Keep it up, can't wait to see the finished result.</li>
