			</figure>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Homepage is index.html?</strong> The homepage is index.html</li>
				<li><strong>No spaces or uppercase in file/folder names?</strong>No uppercase or spaces in any file names. File names labeled accordingly and make sense.</li>
				<li><strong>Design</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Contrast/Sizing</strong>: Everything is very easily readable, contrast looks great and nothing looks out of place.</li>
						<li><strong>Colors and fonts using css, unless specific</strong>: Colors and fonts are in their own CSS file, no page seems to have any specific styling. JS in the page with list of projects done has inline scripting, seems to be short and specific to this page only.</li>
						CRAP
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Contrast passes, feels natural and nothing hurts to look at.</li>
							<li><strong>Repeition</strong>: Every page feels similar to each other, but offers something different.</li>
							<li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Almost every page is centered to the viewport, having all content consolidated and not too far from each other.</li>
							<li><strong>Proximity</strong>: paragraphs are really close to each other, although contrast is good, the readability to me a little difficult since it has the "wall of text" feel. Increasing spacing by a few pixels per line will help this.</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Page has</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Header</strong>: All pages have header included in body. Good looks here.</li>
						<li><strong>Main</strong>: All pages have main included in body. Good looks here too.</li>
						<li><strong>Footer</strong>: All pages have footer included in body. And again, good looks here too.</li>
						<li><strong>Nav Bar Works</strong>: All navigation works great, they are close to each other however, and can be misclicked, this happened to me a few times going back and forth through the pages.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Header has h1</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Branded Page</strong>: Brand name does not seem to be present, Although there is text there and is an h1, I doubt David's Website is the name of the brand.</li>
						<li><strong>Page name not in header</strong>: Page name is not in the header, only the nav and brand name is for all pages.</li>
						<li><strong>Understands difference between head, heading, header</strong>: Very clearly knows the difference, the header, main, footer are all in the body for every page.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Main page starts with h2 and does not repeat h1</strong>: Yes.</li>
				<li><strong>Page has footer with user pages</strong>: Footer has webpages, NickelWebDev.inc webpage does not seem to work. The other link works though.</li>
				<li><strong>Page has specific requirements</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Fully Functional HTML CSS, 5 Page Minimum</strong>: COunted up 7 pages, all with content and works how I feel they were intended.</li>
						<li><strong>All code seperate CSS and JS files</strong>: All CSS was linked, I only found one page with javascript and had it embedded in the page.</li>
						<li><strong>No unnecessary id/classes</strong>: The CSS was hard to follow along with, but I found classes in the CSS that just did not seem to exist in the project.</li>
						<li><strong>All pages have working Nav Bar</strong>: Every page had the same nav bar, all pages work perfectly fine, and go where they are labelled to take you to.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Other Feedback</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li>Make the nav bar text bigger so it is easier to click. Giving the header extra room for those to be bigger and spacing them out will help the header feel less cramped.</li>
						<li>Make a styles and components folder in the project folder itself. Instead of having to "../../". This will help with navigating the linked files in the code, and keep all associated files in the same root folder for this project.</li>
						<li>when using the p or li element, use the CSS style "line-height:  to add spacing in between lines, it will help with the proximity that I explained above.</li>
						<li>Fix the link in the footer to the NickelWebDev.inc link, it is unable to find the page.</li>
						<li>Other than the feedback I received, I really like the webpage. It seems mostly finished, just some little tweaks here and there and it will be good to go!</li>
