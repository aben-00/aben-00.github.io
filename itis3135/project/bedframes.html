                    Bedframes are something I really enjoy making. The bed size is up to you, and if you would a like a bedframe, it is all up to you.
                    My favorite thing about the bed frames is how easy they are to put together, using a modular design makes them easy to get into any room.
                    These bedframes are strong as well when made of cedar wood, my favorite wood to work with. Just like a lot of the other projects I have, using cedar wood makes these bedframes strong and built to last.
