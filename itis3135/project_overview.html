			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>
				My project is going to be a carpenter's page to display pictures of woodworking projects.
				The client is going to be my dad, as for well over 3 years at this point he has wanted a website to show his works.
				This will allow him to easily show his work to people in a singular easy place along with contact information.
				No input will be needed on the visiter's end, it is purely being built to give him his own platform.
			</li>
			<li>The intended users of this is going to be people who are potential customers of my dad. This will allow him to put
				a link on his cards he gives to people so they can see his work without him having to individually send people pictures
				and other information. My dad has laid out what he would like to be on the website so people can contact him and be able
				to get their own product from him.
			</li>
			<li>
				Content on the website is going to be a a small collection of pictures to show some of the work done. There will be
				a small introduction, and a top navigation bar to find a gallery with a collection of even more photos. The gallery will
				be split into different categories that my dad works in. The categories for example will include nightstands and bedframes,
				cabinets, countertops, tables, shelves, and closet linings. In addition, there will also be a list of things my dad has done for
				clients such as replacing windows, doors, flooring, and building porches for people. There will be some pictures included, but it
				will not be a main focus.

			<h3>Design Functionality</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Home page</strong>
					The interactivity being brought to the home page will be the images that lead
					to the information pages, they will expand giving a caption on what the project was
					without making the home page feel bloated. If the user decides they would like to see more
					information about the project, they can click on a button that will show up that will take them
					to the specific information page.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Contact page</strong>
					The only interactivity on this page will be a link to opening the default mail client the user has.
					Nothing Javascript related has been decided for this page.
				</li>
				<li><strong>About page</strong>
					Interactivity just like the contact page will be minimal if any is added at all, links to the home page
					or contact page will work, but nothing on this page will require input from the user.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Gallery page</strong>
					The gallery will be interactive with Javascript for every photo on the page, which will include expanding the image
					and having a caption with the picture. The gallery itself has not been decided, but the client does not want the page
					to feel like it scrolls forever, so the idea is to implement a carousel of images which will be sorted out.
					This could also lead to a filter being implemented, which will make the photo gallery easier for the user to navigate.
					The navigation bar may be smaller on this page to give the user more of the viewport to look at images as well.
