			<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
			
			<section>
				<h3><a class="indent" href="https://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/">Hendrick Motorsports</a></h3>
				
				<p class="text-indent">
					My good example of a webpage is Hendrick Motorsports. I use this website quite often and i am always able to find articles to read, and the schedule all in one place. This website follows the happenings in HMS and is a culmination of articles about their progress, and news nicely consolidated by team.
					I have also noticed that the only colors used on the site is black, white, gray, and red; all other colors only really come from photos, which bodes well since the pictures of articles or the gird of Twitter pictures stand out really well.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Contrast</b>: The contrast is really good, from finding articles on the specific drivers on the team, or even just news on what the organization's been working on.</li>
					<li><b>Repetition</b>: The use of font seems to be only one used throughout the website. Differentiating then becomes a mix of red headlines or emboldening. colors are consistent, only using black and red, then pictures give the website the extra color it would otherwise lack.</li>
					<li><b>Alignment</b>: The headlining news take up an entire line, with the very top showing a revolving thumbnail of the top four news articles. Below that is other articles in a grid formation, show and detailing the headline and thumbnail to go with them, along with the publish date.</li>
					<li><b>Proximity</b>: the upcoming race location, time, and where to watch is all in the same easy to access place, along with articles of the previous event. This very easy to find any information, and allows a user to come on this site and easily navigate to the information they wanted.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a class="indent" href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Ling's Cars</a></h3>
				
				<p class="text-indent">
					This website is awful! Ling's Cars embraces the wackiness it has and I really enjoy it because of that. This website is for a car broker located in the UK, and is used to display cars along with monthly payments and information to find and contact Ling's.
					the background is not very bothersome, as the content itself has a white background. I cannot help but feel overwhelmed while looking at this website though! There is so much going on with flashing lightning bolts, Ling's faces constantly moving, and the use of over 10 different fonts from what I can tell including comic sans!
					The embrace for the absolute insanity though is why it is one of my favorite websites though, this does make looking for a car feel even more fun.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Contrast</b>: There are colors everywhere! the white background helps being able to read stuff, but in just a single little screenshot I have red, blue, brown, green, yellow, black, purple, and pink! It is absolute chaos! The contrast is very much there, but is very chaotic.</li>
					<li><b>Repetition</b>: Repetition does not seem to be too bad though. The insane contrast is being use consistently, the cars are lined up nicely, and the lightning bolts when I first saw them immediately let me know that there is an electric car. This really feels uniform enough and I do think this did an okay job other than the fonts.</li>
					<li><b>Alignment</b>: Alignment is not bad either. The cars are arranged in a horizontal grid instead of a singular one, but it works well enough. The car brands on the left however, could have been done better. Maybe instead have them in a grid as well so they do not take up so much space? Also at the very bottom, the Twitter logo breaks into two, weird.</li>
					<li><b>Proximity</b>: The proximity of the same type of element like the cars are done alright, they keep to themselves on the webpage and do not seem to get in the way of other stuff. The cars and links to other pages however, are a mess! The cars extend the page well past what is needed, and the links to Facebook and Twitter are placed in weird spots. The top ones are to the right and I feel are only really seen because of the gif,
						and the bottom ones are tiny and break if the display width gets too small.</li>
